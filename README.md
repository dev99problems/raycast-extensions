Home of **dev99problems'** `raycast` **extensions**

## Raycast
[raycast app](https://www.raycast.com/) is the tool, that can be described as `Spotlight` on steroids.
It is **simple**, **flexible**, does not require any **~~paid subscription~~**, and provides a great way of interacting with your MacOS device/internet.

So `this repo` is a home for my personal `extensions`, which I use on daily basis. Nothing huge,
just the small simple things, which `make my life easier`.

## List of Extensions
TBD
